# PDF To Image API - Python

![Image Icon showing PDF to Image](images/convert.jpg "PDF to Image Banner")


## Overview

Due to the pandemic we have found ourselves sharing PDF's more than ever. However still some people face problem understanding the PDF file or opening the same on a compatible app. In all most applications, a person can view a page in the app itself, without installing a different application all together.   

To enable the same, [@formula21](https://formula21.github.io) has bought you an API which accepts a PDF file only to convert it's page(s) to high quality image(s).

Built in Python and deployed through Flask Server, the integrated experience is tailored to any user(s) experience.
